Hey there!! The guy in the picture is me .An Information Technology Engineering graduate who is passionate about technology hailing from a quaint town in Andhra Pradesh, India .


Iâ€™m very passionate about how all pieces work together to make something bigger happen. Does the last sentence ring you a profession ?? Yep, You are right! It's DevOps. As a DevOps Engineer I got to build the systems and processes to make a smooth Developer Experience . It was very interesting to interact with Frontend , Backend and Database . 


I document all of my learning in this website . I love to connect with you and exchange discussions . you can always hit me up through my twitter, email or linkedln .
